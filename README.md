# Analysis of Comcast Telecom Consumer Complaints

**Description:**

Comcast, a major American global telecommunications company, has faced significant challenges regarding its customer service. Despite repeated commitments to improvement, the company's service quality has consistently fallen short. This issue culminated in a $2.3 million fine imposed by authorities in October 2016 following an influx of over 1000 consumer complaints.

This project delves into the underlying issues plaguing Comcast's customer service by analyzing complaint data through insightful visualizations. The goal is to identify key problem areas and provide a clearer understanding of the customer experience.

**Analysis Approach:**

The analysis was conducted using various Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for potential future analysis. The following steps were undertaken:

1.  **Data Import:** The consumer complaints data was loaded into the Python environment using Pandas.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
    * Irrelevant columns were dropped to streamline the dataset.
    * Specific columns were renamed for better clarity and consistency.
    * The combined 'Date-Month' column was separated into individual 'Date' and 'Month' columns to facilitate time-based analysis.
3.  **Monthly Complaint Aggregation:** A table summarizing the total number of complaints received each month was calculated.
4.  **Monthly Complaint Trend Visualization:** A line chart was generated to visualize the trend of complaint volume over time at a monthly level. This helps identify any seasonal patterns or significant fluctuations in complaints.
5.  **Daily Complaint Trend Visualization:** A bar chart was created to illustrate the daily complaint volume, providing a more granular view of complaint occurrences.
6.  **Month-wise Complaint Distribution:** A bar chart was used to display the distribution of complaints across different months, highlighting months with higher complaint volumes.
7.  **Complaint Type Frequency Analysis:** A table was generated to show the frequency of different types of complaints reported by customers.
8.  **Complaint Type Visualization:** A line chart was used to visualize the frequency of different complaint types, making it easier to identify the most common issues.
9.  **Complaint Status Categorization and Visualization:** A new categorical variable, 'Complaint Status Group', was created by consolidating the original status categories: 'Open' (for 'Open' and 'Pending') and 'Closed' (for 'Closed' and 'Solved'). The distribution of these grouped statuses was then visualized using both bar and pie charts to provide a clear understanding of the resolution rates.
10. **State-wise Complaint Status Analysis:** A table was created to show the status of complaints in each state. This information was then visualized using a stacked bar chart to compare the proportion of open and closed complaints across different states.

**Key Findings:**

The analysis aimed to answer the following crucial questions:

1.  **State with Maximum Complaints:** Identification of the state that generated the highest number of complaints.
2.  **State with Highest Unresolved Complaints:** Determination of the state with the highest percentage of complaints that remained unresolved (Open or Pending).
3.  **Total Resolved Complaints (Specific Criteria):** Calculation of the total number of complaints resolved up to the analysis date, potentially based on specific criteria or filters applied during the analysis.
4.  **Percentage of Resolved Complaints (Specific Criteria):** Calculation of the percentage of complaints resolved up to the analysis date, again potentially based on specific criteria.
